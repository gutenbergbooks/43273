<p class="break center p2">ZEN BUDDHISM<br />
AND ITS RELATION TO ART</p>


<p>Books on the Far East often mention a sect of Buddhism
called Zen. They say that it was a “school of abstract meditation”
and that it exercised a profound influence upon art
and literature; but they tell us very little about what Zen
actually was, about its relation to ordinary Buddhism, its
history, or the exact nature of its influence upon the arts.</p>

<p>The reason of this is that very little of the native literature
which deals with Zen has yet been translated, perhaps because
it is written in early Chinese colloquial, a language the study
of which has been almost wholly neglected by Europeans and
also (to judge by some of their attempts to translate it) by the
Japanese themselves.</p>

<p>The present paper makes no attempt at profundity, but it
is based on the study of original texts and furnishes, I hope,
some information not hitherto accessible.</p>

<hr class="tb" />

<p>Before describing the origins of Zen itself I must give some
general account of Buddhism. At the time when it reached
China<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> there were two kinds of Buddhism, called the Lesser
Vehicle and the Greater. The former, Primitive Buddhism,
possessed scriptures which in part at any rate were genuine;
that is to say, they recorded words actually used by Shākyamuni.
The ordinary adherent of this religion did not hope to
become a Buddha; Buddhas indeed were regarded as extremely
rare. He only aspired to become an Arhat, that is “an ascetic
ripe for annihilation,” one who is about to escape from the
wheel of reincarnation&mdash;whose present incarnation is an antechamber
to Nirvāna. To such aspirants the Buddha gives no
assistance; he is what children in their games call “home,”
and his followers must pant after him as best they can.</p>

<p>Those who found this religion too comfortless invented
another, which became known as Mahāyāna, the Greater
Vehicle. Putting their doctrines into the mouth of Shākya<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>muni,
they fabricated <i>ad hoc</i> sermons of enormous length,
preached (so they asserted) by the Buddha himself in his
“second period” to those who were ripe to receive the whole
truth.</p>

<p>The great feature of this new Buddhism was the intervention
of the merciful Bodhisattvas, <i>illuminati</i> who, though fit
for Buddhahood, voluntarily renounced it in order to help
mankind.</p>

<p>The first Buddhist books to reach China emanated from
the Lesser Vehicle. But the Greater Vehicle or Bodhisattva-Buddhism
soon prevailed, and by the sixth century <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> over
two thousand works, most of them belonging to the Greater
Vehicle, had been translated into Chinese.</p>


<h2>BUDDHIST SECTS.</h2>

<p>There were already many sects in China, the chief of which
were:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>(1) <i>The Amidists.</i></p>

<p>This was the form of Buddhism which appealed to the
uneducated. It taught that a Buddha named Amida presides
over the Western Paradise, where he will receive the
souls of those that worship him. The conception of this
Paradise closely resembles the Christian idea of Heaven and
may have been derived from it.</p>

<p>(2) The <i>Tendai</i> Sect, founded at the end of the sixth
century. Its teaching was based on a scripture of enormous
length called the <i>Saddharma Pundarīka Sūtra</i>, which is
translated by Kern in the Sacred Books of the East. It was
perhaps the broadest and most representative sect. It laid
great stress on the ethical side of Buddhism.</p></div>

<p>We now come to <i>Zen</i>.</p>

<p>In the year 520 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> there arrived at Canton a missionary
from Southern India. His name was Bodhidharma and he
appears to have been the younger son of an Indian Prince.</p>

<p>The reigning Emperor of China was a munificent patron of
Buddhism. He had built monasteries, given alms, distributed
scriptures, defended the faith. Hearing that a Buddhist prince
had arrived from India he summoned him at once to his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>
Capital. The following conversation took place in the Palace
at Nanking:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Emperor</i>: You will be interested to hear that I have built
many monasteries, distributed scriptures, given
alms, and upheld the Faith. Have I not indeed
acquired merit?</p>

<p><i>Bodhidharma</i>: None at all.</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i>: In what then does true merit consist?</p>

<p><i>Bodhidharma</i>: In the obliteration of Matter through Absolute
Knowledge, not by external acts.</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i>: Which is the Divine and Primal Aspect of
Reality?</p>

<p><i>Bodhidharma</i>: Reality has no aspect that is divine.</p>

<p><i>Emperor</i>: What are you, who have come before my
Throne?</p>

<p><i>Bodhidharma</i>: I do not know.</p></div>

<p>The Emperor could make nothing of him. Monasticism,
a huge vested interest, decried him, and after a short stay in
Nanking he started northward, towards the Capital of the Wei
Tartars, who then ruled over a large part of China. The Wei
Emperor, like his Chinese confrère, was also a great patron of
Buddhism, and he, too, desired an interview with the Indian
priest. But Bodhidharma had done with Emperors, and
settled in a small country temple, where he lived till his death
nine years later. Some say that he tried to visit the Capital
of the Weis, but was prevented by the intrigues of the monks
there.</p>

<p>He left behind him a few short tractates, the substance of
which is as follows:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>There is no such person as Buddha. Buddha is simply a
Sanskrit word meaning “initiate.” The Absolute is immanent
in every man’s heart. This “treasure of the heart”
is the only Buddha that exists. It is no use seeking Buddha
outside your own nature. Prayer, scripture-reading, fasting,
the observance of monastic rules&mdash;all are useless. Those
who seek Buddha do not find him. You may know by heart
all the Sūtras of the twelve divisions, and yet be unable to
escape from the Wheel of Life and Death. One thing alone<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>
avails&mdash;to discover the unreality of the World by contemplating
the Absolute which is at the root of one’s own nature.</p></div>

<p>Some one asked him: “Why may we not worship the
Buddhas and Bodhisattvas?” He answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Ogres and hobgoblins can at will assume the outward
form of Bodhisattvas; such are heretical and not of the true
Buddha. There is no Buddha but your own thoughts.
Buddha is the Way. The Way is Zen. This word Zen
cannot be understood even of the wise. Zen means ‘for a
man to behold his fundamental nature.’”<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a></p></div>

<hr class="tb" />

<div class="blockquot">

<p>The highest truths cannot be written down or taught by
speech. A man who cannot write a word, can yet contemplate
his own heart and become wise. Knowledge of
1,000 Sūtras and 10,000 Shāstras cannot help him to realise
the Absolute within him.</p></div>

<p>He was asked: “Can a layman with wife and children,
one given over to the lusts of the flesh, achieve Buddhahood?”
He answered:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Provided he contemplate his own inner-nature, he will
achieve Buddhahood. It does not matter about his lusts.
Even a butcher can achieve Buddhahood, if he searches in
his own heart.”</p></div>

<p>“What,” cried his listeners, “a butcher, who lives by taking
life, and <i>he</i> achieve Buddhahood?” The master replied:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It is not a question of the man’s trade. If he has
learnt to know his own nature he will be saved.</p>

<p>“I have come from India only to teach you that Buddha
is Thought. I care nothing for monastic rules or ascetic
practices. As for walking on water or through fire, climbing
sword-wheels, fasting, sitting upright for hours without
rest&mdash;all such practices are heretical; they belong to the
World of Being.</p>

<p>“Thought, Thought, Thought! It is hard to seek.
Expanding, it covers the whole world; shrinking, it is too
small to lodge a pin.</p>

<p>“I seek the heart; I do not seek Buddha. For I have<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>
learnt to know that the outer world is empty and untenanted.”</p></div>

<p>Such was the teaching of Bodhidharma. It was Vedantic<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a>
rather than Buddhist. The terms “thought,” “Buddha,”
etc., used by Bodhidharma correspond exactly to the <i>brahman</i>
of the Upanishads. Mystic contemplation or <i>yoga</i> had been
used by the Brahmins and was not unknown to the early
Buddhists. But Bodhidharma was the first to insist upon it
as the sole means of salvation.</p>

<p>Yet though his whole teaching turned on this “meditation”
or “Zen,” he left behind him no exact directions for the
practice of it. Having shown the end, he left it to each individual
to find his own means. Rules, dogmas and definitions
were precisely what he set out to destroy.</p>

<p>Less than a hundred years after his death another Indian,
Buddhapriya, came to China and there defined with exactitude
and blunt materiality the various forms of meditation.</p>

<p>The transition from the spirituality of Bodhidharma to the
grossness of his follower is, however, typical of religious
history. The poetry of Christ turns into the theology of
Paul; the hovel of Saint Francis into the mansion of Brother
Elias.</p>


<h2>BUDDHAPRIYA.</h2>

<p>He first describes the different attitudes in which Zen may
be practised, with an exact account of the correct position for
hands, feet, head, etc. The normal attitude of meditation,
cross-legged, with upright back and hands locked over the
knees is familiar to every one.</p>

<p>Zen could also be practised while walking and, in cases of
sickness, while lying down. Buddhapriya’s instructions are
in the form of question and answer.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;How does the Zen practised by heretics and
by the other schools of Buddhism differ from our
Zen?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;The Zen of the heretics is not impersonal. The
Zen of the Lesser Vehicle is material. The Zen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>
of the Greater Vehicle only abstracts man and
phenomena.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;How ought one to set about practising Zen?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;First put far away from you all anger and malice,
and fill your heart with kindness and compassion.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Can the beginner at once proceed to the contemplation
of non-Being?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;By no means! He must by stratagems gradually
enter in. I have never yet seen one who straightway
achieved the vision of non-Reality. If for
example he were meditating in this room he must
first banish from his mind every part of the world
except the city of Ch’ang-an. Next every building
in the city except this monastery. Next, every
room in the monastery except this cell, every object
but himself, every part of himself except the end
of his nose. Finally the end of his nose hangs in
space like a drop of dew and on this nose-end he
concentrates his mind.</p>

<p>This is only a preliminary exercise. There are
others of the same kind. For example&mdash;persuade
yourself that your navel is a minute rivulet running
through the sands. When this conception is firmly
achieved, you will see a bright light and ultimately,
the body growing transparent, you will behold the
working of your bowels.</p>

<p>Or again, regard your head as the top of a
hollow pipe which runs straight down through your
body into the earth. Meditate upon the top of
your head, that is to say, upon the mouth of the
drain-pipe, and then gradually ascend in your
thoughts to a height of four inches above the head,
and concentrate firmly on this conception. You
will thus easily pass into the contemplation of non-Being,
having performed the transition from elementary
to complete Zen as comfortably as a workman
climbs the rungs of a ladder.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Are there any signs whereby I may know that
I have attained to Samādhi?<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span><a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a></p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;To be sure there are. Sometimes you will feel
a sensation as of bugs or ants creeping over your
skin; or again, it will appear to you that a cloud
or mass of white cotton-wool is rising immediately
behind your back. In neither case must you
be discomposed or put out your hand. Sometimes
it will seem as though oil were dripping down from
your head and face; sometimes a light will shine
from out of the ground you are sitting upon.</p>

<p>These are all preliminary signs.</p>

<p>Sometimes when you have been sitting for a
long while and your back is aching, you will suddenly
hear a sound of rapping with the fingers or a
noise as of some one bumping against the door.
Do not be disquieted. These are the Good Spirits
of Heaven, come to warn you against sleep.</p>

<p>Again, it may happen that you have an agreeable
sense of lightness and floating; this is a good
sign. Beware, however, of a <i>painful</i> sense of
lightness; for this may merely indicate flatulence.</p>

<p>Patches of heat on the body are a sign of Fiery
Samādhi. A light filling the whole room is a premonitory
sign of Zen; to smell strange fragrances
not known on earth is a sign of whole and utter
Abstraction.</p>

<p>Such and many more are the signs of Zen.
The practicant must not heed them; for if by them
he be encouraged or dismayed, all his work will be
undone.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Can Zen be practised in a Buddha Shrine?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;No, indeed! Zen should be practised in a quiet
room or under a tree or among tombs or sitting on
the dewy earth.</p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Can Zen be practised by many sitting together?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;To be sure it may; but each must face his neighbour’s
back. They must not sit face to face. When
there are many sitting together at night, a lamp or
candle may be lit; but when there are few together,
it ought not to be used.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span></p>

<p><i>Question.</i>&mdash;Need I wear monastic vestments at my
meditations?</p>

<p><i>Answer.</i>&mdash;Vestments? Why, you need wear no clothes at
all, if so be you are alone.</p></div>


<h2>LATER DEVELOPMENT OF ZEN.</h2>

<p>Zen was at first a purely personal discipline, non-monastic,
non-ethical, not demanding the acceptance of any Scripture
or any tradition. In modern Japan it has to some extent
regained this character. In China the habit of quoting written
authority was too strong to be easily discarded. The Zen
masters soon began to answer difficult questions by quoting
from the Buddhist Scriptures. Convenience dictated that
practicants of Zen should live in communities and monasticism
was soon established in their sect, as in every other sect of
Buddhism. Questions of conduct arose, and Zen was squared
with the contemporary ethical outlook; though in medieval
Japanese literature wicked and cynical persons are generally
depicted as adepts of Zen.</p>

<p>Bodhidharma denied the existence of Good and Evil; but
it was pointed out by later apologists that the Zen adept,
having viewed the Absolute, is convinced of the unreality and
futility of those pleasures and possessions which are the incentive
to sin. The Zen practicant, though he makes no moral
effort, nevertheless is certain not to sin, because he is certain
not to be tempted.</p>

<p>Finally, Zen forged itself a tradition. Probably during
the eleventh century a Scripture<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> was fabricated which recounts
how once when Buddha was preaching, he plucked a flower
and smiled. Only the disciple Kāshyapa understood the
significance of this act. Between him and the Buddha there
passed a wordless communication of Absolute Truths. This
communication was silently passed on by Kāshyapa to his
disciple, and so ultimately to Bodhidharma, who brought it
to China.</p>

<p>The method of teaching by symbolic acts (such as the
plucking of a flower) was extensively used by the Zen masters.
For example, when a disciple asked Enkwan a question about<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>
the nature of Buddha, he answered, “Bring me a clean bowl.”
When the priest brought the bowl, the master said, “Now
put it back where you found it.” He signified that the priest’s
questionings must return to their proper place, the questioner’s
heart, from which alone spiritual knowledge can be obtained.</p>

<p>The object of the Zen teachers, as of some eccentric schoolmasters
whom I have known, seems at first sight to have been
merely to puzzle and surprise their pupils to the highest
possible degree. A peculiar “brusquerie” was developed in
Zen monasteries. The literature of the sect consists chiefly
in an endless series of anecdotes recording the minutest
happenings in the lives of famous Zen monks and their
(apparently) most trivial sayings. But behind these trifling
acts and sayings a deep meaning lay hid. The interpretation
of such teaching depends on a complete knowledge of the
symbolism used. I am not inclined to agree with those
students of Zen who assert that its written teaching are
wholly devoid of intellectual content or so completely esoteric
as not to admit of explanation in words. Like other Buddhist
philosophers the Zen masters were chiefly concerned with the
attempt to define the relation between the One and the Many,
between the subjective and objective aspects of life.</p>

<p>The idealism of Zen does not mean that the phenomenal
world has no importance. To those who have not reached
complete self-realisation the urgencies of that world remain
paramount and are the only stepping-stones upon which he
can climb higher.</p>

<p>On the day of his arrival at the monastery a novice presented
himself before the abbot, begging to be allowed to begin
his spiritual exercises without further delay. “Have you had
supper?” asked the abbot. “Yes.” “Then go and wash
your plate.”</p>


<h2>THE ZEN MASTERS.</h2>

<p>Let us begin with Enō, a master of the seventh century. He
lost his parents when he was young and earned his living by
gathering firewood. One day when he was in the market-place
he heard some one reading the Diamond Sūtra.<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> He<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>
asked where such books were to be had and was told “From
Master Kōnin on the Yellow Plum-blossom Hill.” Accordingly
he went to Kōnin’s Monastery in Anhui and presented
himself before the Master. “Where do you come from?”
“From the South.” “Bah! In the South they have not
Buddha in their souls.” “North and South,” replied Enō,
“are human distinctions that Buddha knows nothing of.”</p>

<p>Kōnin accepted him as a lay-brother and put him to pound
rice in the bakery.</p>

<p>Kōnin was growing old and wished to choose his successor.
He therefore instituted a poetical competition in which each
monk was to epitomise in a quatrain the essence of Zen. The
favourite candidate was the warden Shinshū, who sent in the
following verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">The body is the trunk of the Bodhi-tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The mind is the bright mirror’s stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Scrub your mirror continually,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Lest the dust eclipse its brightness.<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>Enō, as a lay-brother, was not qualified to compete. Some
one told him of Shinshū’s quatrain. “Mine would be very
different,” he exclaimed, and persuaded one of the boys employed
in the bakery to go stealthily by night and inscribe the
following poem on the monastery-wall:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">Knowledge is not a tree;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">The Mirror has no stand;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">Since nothing exists,<br /></span>
<span class="i0">How could dust rise and cover it?<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>The authorship of the poem was discovered and the abbot
Kōnin visited Enō in the bakery. “Is your rice white or
no?” he asked. “White?” answered Enō; “it has not yet
been sifted.” Thereupon the abbot struck three times on the
rice-mortar with his staff and departed. Enō understood his
meaning. That night at the third watch he came to Kōnin’s
cell and was invested with the abbot’s mantle, thereby becoming
the Sixth Patriarch of the Zen Church. He died in 712 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>,
without having learned how to read or write.</p>


<h2>FASHIONABLE ZEN.</h2>

<p>The warden Shinshū had lost the Patriarchate and with it
the spiritual headship of Zen. But as a compensation Fate<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>
had in store for him worldly triumphs of the most dazzling
kind. Leaving the rural monastery of Kōnin, he entered the
Temple of the Jade fountain in the great city of Kingchau.
His fame soon spread over central China. He was a man of
“huge stature, bushy eyebrows and shapely ears.” The
Empress Wu Hou, who had usurped the throne of China,
notoriously cultivated the society of handsome priests. About
684 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> she summoned him to the Capital. Instead of commanding
his presence at Court she came in a litter to his lodgings
and actually knelt down before him. The friendship of this
murderous and fiendishly cruel woman procured for him
temporal dignities which in the eyes of the world completely
outshone the rustic piety of the Sixth Patriarch. Shinshū at
the Capital became as it were the Temporal Father of Zen,
while Enō at his country monastery remained its spiritual
pope. The successors of Enō became known as the Fathers
of the Southern School; while the courtly and social Zen of
Shinshū is called Zen of the North.</p>

<p>Was it in sincere goodwill or with the desire to discredit
his rival that Shinshū invited Enō to join him at the Capital?
In any case Enō had the good sense to refuse. “I am a man
of low stature and humble appearance,” he replied; “I fear
that the men of the North would despise me and my doctrines”&mdash;thus
hinting (with just that touch of malice which so often
spices the unworldly) that Shinshū’s pre-eminence in the
North was due to outward rather than to spiritual graces.</p>

<p>Shinshū died in 706, outliving his august patroness by a
year. To perpetuate his name a palace was turned into a
memorial monastery; the Emperor’s brother wrote his
epitaph; his obsequies were celebrated with stupendous pomp.</p>

<p>His successor, Fujaku, at first remained at the Kingchau
monastery where he had been Shinshū’s pupil. But in 724 the
irresolute Emperor Ming-huang, who had proscribed Buddhism
ten years before, summoned Fujaku to the Imperial City.
Here princes and grandees vied with one another in doing him
honour. “The secret of his success,” says the historian,<a name="FNanchor_7_7" id="FNanchor_7_7"></a><a href="#Footnote_7_7" class="fnanchor">[7]</a>
“was that he seldom spoke and generally looked cross. Hence
his rare words and occasional smiles acquired in the eyes of his<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>
admirers an unmerited value.” He died at the age of 89. On
the day of his interment the great streets of Ch’ang-an were
empty. The whole city had joined in the funeral procession.
The Governor of Honan (one of the greatest functionaries in
the State), together with his wife and children, all of them
clad in monastic vestments, followed the bier, mingling with
the promiscuous crowd of his admirers and disciples.</p>

<p>Religion was at that time fashionable in the high society
of Ch’ang-an, as it is to-day in the great Catholic capitals of
Munich, Vienna or Seville. When I read of Fujaku’s burial
another scene at once sprang into my mind, the funeral of a
great Bavarian dignitary, where I saw the noblemen of Munich
walk hooded and barefoot through the streets.</p>

<p>I shall not refer again to the Northern School of Zen.
One wonders whether the founders of religions are forced by
fate to watch the posthumous development of their creeds. If
so, theirs must be the very blackest pit of Hell.</p>

<p>Let us return to the Southern School, always regarded as
the true repository of Zen tradition.</p>


<h2>ŌBAKU.</h2>

<p>Ōbaku lived at the beginning of the ninth century, and was
thus a contemporary of the poet Po Chü-i. He enjoyed the
patronage of a distinguished statesman the Chancellor Hai
Kyū, of whom the Emperor said, “This is indeed a true Confucian.”
It is to the Chancellor that we owe the record of
Ōbaku’s conversations, which he wrote down day by day. I
will make a few extracts from this diary:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>Hai Kyū.&mdash;Enō could not read or write. How came it that
he succeeded to the Patriarchate of Kōnin? The
warden Shinshū was in control of 500 monks, gave
lectures, and could discourse upon thirty-two
different Sūtras and Shāstras. It was certainly
very strange that he was not made Patriarch.</p>

<p>Ōbaku (replying).&mdash;Shinshū’s conception of Thought was
too material. His proofs and practices were too
positive.</p></div>

<p>“The master told me that when he was studying with
Enkwan, the Emperor Tai Chung came dressed as a monk.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>
The master happened to be in the chapel prostrating himself
before an image of Buddha. The Emperor, who thought he
had learnt the lesson of Zen idealism, said to him: ‘There
is nothing to be got from Buddha, nothing from the Church,
nothing from Man; for nothing exists. What do you mean
by praying at your age?’</p>

<p>“Ōbaku answered him: ‘I seek nothing of Buddha, the
Church, or of Man. I am in the habit of praying.’ The
Emperor said: ‘What do you do it for?’ Ōbaku lost
patience and struck him with his fist. ‘You rude fellow,’
cried the Emperor. ‘Since nothing exists, what difference
does it make to you whether I am rude or polite?’ and
Ōbaku struck him again. The Emperor retreated hastily.”</p>

<p>In his old age Ōbaku visited his native village and stayed
a year in his mother’s house, without revealing his identity.
After he had set out again for his monastery, his mother suddenly
realised that he was her son and went in pursuit of him.
She reached the shore of a certain river, only to see him disembarking
on the other side. Thereupon she lost her reason and
flung herself into the water.</p>

<p>Ōbaku threw a lighted torch after her and recited the following
verses:</p>

<div class="poem"><div class="stanza">
<i><span class="i0">May the wide river dry at its source, to its very bed<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If here the crime of matricide has been done;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">When one son becomes a priest, the whole family is born again in Heaven;<br /></span>
<span class="i0">If that is a lie, all that Buddha promised is a lie.<br /></span></i>
</div></div>

<p>Henceforward the throwing of a lighted torch into the bier
became part of the Zen funeral ceremony; it was accompanied
by the reciting of the above verses. Probably formula, ritual,
and story alike belong to a period much more ancient than
Buddhism.</p>

<p>In the seventeenth century a Chinese priest named Ingen<a name="FNanchor_8_8" id="FNanchor_8_8"></a><a href="#Footnote_8_8" class="fnanchor">[8]</a>
carried the teaching of Ōbaku to Japan, where it now possesses
nearly 700 temples.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span></p>

<h2>BASO.</h2>

<p>Baso was a master of the ninth century. One day he was
sitting with his feet across the garden-path. A monk came
along with a wheel-barrow. “Tuck in your feet,” said the
monk. “What has been extended cannot be retracted,”
answered Baso. “What has been started cannot be stopped,”
cried the monk and pushed the barrow over Baso’s feet. The
master hobbled to the monastery and seizing an axe called out
“Have any of you seen the rascal who hurt my feet?” The
monk who had pushed the barrow then came out and stood
“with craned head.” The master laid down his axe.</p>

<p>To understand this story we must realise that the wheel-barrow
is here a symbol of the Wheel of Life and Death, which,
though every spoke of it is illusion, cannot be disregarded till
we have destroyed the last seed of phenomenal perception in us.</p>


<h2>RINZAI.</h2>

<p>Ōbaku, as we have seen, taught wisdom with his fists.
When the novice Rinzai came to him and asked him what
was the fundamental idea of Buddhism, Ōbaku hit him three
times with his stick. Rinzai fled and presently met the monk
Daigu.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p><i>Daigu</i>: Where do you come from?</p>

<p><i>Rinzai</i>: From Ōbaku.</p>

<p><i>Daigu</i>: And what stanza did he lecture upon?</p>

<p><i>Rinzai</i>: I asked him thrice what was the fundamental
doctrine of Buddhism and each time he hit me with
his stick. Please tell me if I did something I
ought not to have done?</p>

<p><i>Daigu</i>: You go to Ōbaku and torture him by your questions,
and then ask if you have done wrong!</p></div>

<p>At that moment Rinzai had a Great Enlightenment.</p>

<p>Rinzai substituted howling for Ōbaku’s manual violence.
He shouted meaningless syllables at his disciples; roared like
a lion or bellowed like a bull. This “howling” became a
regular part of Zen practice, and may be compared to the yelling
of the American Shakers. Upon his deathbed Rinzai summoned
his disciples round him and asked which of them felt<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>
capable of carrying on his work. Sanshō volunteered to do so.
“How will you tell people what was Rinzai’s teaching?” asked
Rinzai. Sanshō threw out his chest and roared in a manner
which he thought would gratify the master. But Rinzai
groaned and cried out, “To think that such a blind donkey
should undertake to hand on my teaching!”</p>

<p>It was in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries that Zen
most completely permeated Chinese thought. Upon the invasion
of the Mongols<a name="FNanchor_9_9" id="FNanchor_9_9"></a><a href="#Footnote_9_9" class="fnanchor">[9]</a> many Zen monks from Eastern China
took refuge in Japan; the same thing happened during the
Manchu invasion in the seventeenth century. But by that time
Zen had a serious philosophic rival.</p>

<p>In the fifteenth century the philosopher Wang Yang-ming
began to propagate a doctrine which, in all but names, strongly
resembled the philosophic side of Zen. He taught that in each
one of us is a “higher nature,” something which, borrowing a
phrase from Mencius, he called “Good Knowledge.” Of this
inner nature he speaks in exactly the same terms as the Zen
teachers spoke of their “Buddha immanent in man’s heart.”
He even uses the same kind of doggerel-verse as a medium of
teaching.</p>

<p>Rigid Confucianists, who would not have listened to any
doctrine of professedly Buddhist origin, were able through
Wang Yang-ming’s tact to accept the philosophy of Zen without
feeling that they were betraying the Confucian tradition.
The followers of Yang-ming are to-day very numerous both in
China and Japan. They cultivate introspection, but not the
complete self-hypnosis of Zen.</p>

<p>In China, where Zen is almost forgotten, the followers of
this later doctrine are not even aware of its derivation.</p>


<h2>ZEN AND ART.</h2>

<p>I said at the beginning of this paper that Zen is often
mentioned by writers on Far Eastern Art. The connection
between Zen and art is important, not only because of the
inspiration which Zen gave to the artist, but also because
through Zen was obtained a better understanding of the psycho<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>logical
conditions under which art is produced than has prevailed
in any other civilisation.</p>

<p>Art was regarded as a kind of Zen, as a delving down into
the Buddha that each of us unknowingly carries within him,
as Benjamin carried Joseph’s cup in his sack. Through Zen
we annihilate Time and see the Universe not split up into
myriad fragments, but in its primal unity. Unless, says the
Zen æsthetician, the artist’s work is imbued with this vision
of the subjective, non-phenomenal aspect of life, his productions
will be mere toys.</p>

<p>I do not mean to suggest that Chinese artists found in Zen
a short cut to the production of beauty. Zen aims at the
annihilation of consciousness, whereas art is produced by an
interaction of conscious and unconscious faculties. How far
such an interaction can be promoted by the psychic discipline
of Zen no layman can judge; moreover the whole question of
the artist’s psychology is controversial and obscure.</p>

<p>Perhaps it is not even very important that the artist himself
should have a sound æsthetic; but it is of the utmost importance
to the artist that the public should have some notion of
the conditions under which art can be produced&mdash;should have
some key to the vagaries of a section of humanity which will
in any case always be found troublesome and irritating.</p>

<p>Such a key Zen supplied, and it is in the language of Zen
that, after the twelfth century, art is usually discussed in
China and Japan.</p>


<h2>THE ROKUTSŪJI SCHOOL.</h2>

<p>One institution, about which till recently very little was
known, seems to have been an important factor in the propagation
of Zen art and ideas. About 1215 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span> a Zen priest
came from the far south-west of China to Hangchow, the
Capital, and there refounded a ruined monastery, the Rokutsūji,
which stood on the shores of the famous Western Lake. His
name was Mokkei. He seems to have been the first to practise
the swift, ecstatic type of monochrome which is associated
with Zen. In hurried swirls of ink he sought to record before
they faded visions and exaltations produced whether by the
frenzy of wine, the stupor of tea, or the vacancy of absorption.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span></p>

<p>Sometimes his design is tangled and chaotic; sometimes as
in his famous “Persimmons,”<a name="FNanchor_10_10" id="FNanchor_10_10"></a><a href="#Footnote_10_10" class="fnanchor">[10]</a> passion has congealed into a
stupendous calm.</p>

<p>Of his fellow-workers the best known is Rasō, a painter of
birds and flowers. Ryōkai, once a fashionable painter, left the
Court and with his pupil Rikaku worked in the manner of
Mokkei.</p>

<p>Examples of Ryōkai’s work before and after his conversion
are still preserved in Japan.</p>

<p>Finally, about the middle of the fourteenth century, a
Japanese priest came to China and, under circumstances which
I shall describe in an appendix, confusingly became Mokkei II.
It may be that it was he who sent back to his own country
some of the numerous pictures signed Mokkei which are now
in Japan. Which of them are by Mokkei and which by
Mokuan is a problem which remains to be solved.</p>

<p>This Zen art did not flourish long in China, nor in all probability
do many specimens of it survive there. But in Japan
it was a principal source of inspiration to the great painters
of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Sesshū himself is
the direct descendant of Mokkei; as in a decadent way are
Kanō masters such as Tsunenobu.</p>

<p>Zen paintings are of two kinds. (1) Representations of
animals, birds and flowers, in which the artist attempted to
identify himself with the object depicted, to externise its inner
Buddha. These were achieved not by study from the life, as
the early Sung nature-pieces have been, but by intense and
concentrated visualisation of the subject to be painted. This
mental picture was rapidly transferred to paper before the spell
of concentration (samādhi) was broken. (2) Illustrations of
episodes in the lives of the great Zen teachers. This branch
of Zen art was essentially dramatic. It sought to express the
characters of the persons involved, subtly to reveal the
grandeur of soul that lay hidden behind apparent uncouthness
or stupidity. Typical of this kind of painting are the pictures
of “Tanka burning the Image.”</p>

<p>One night Tanka, a Zen priest, stayed as a guest at an ordinary
Buddhist monastery. There was no firewood in his cell.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>
As the night was cold he went into the chapel, seized a wooden
statue of Shākyamuni and, chopping it up, made himself a
comfortable fire. To him the idol of Buddha was a mere block
of wood; his indignant hosts took a different view. The
controversy is the same as that which occupies the central
place in the Nō play <i>Sotoba Komachi</i>.</p>

<p>There is another aspect of Zen which had an equally
important effect on art. The Buddha-nature is immanent not
in Man only, but in everything that exists, animate or inanimate.
Stone, river and tree are alike parts of the great hidden
Unity. Thus Man, through his Buddha-nature or universalised
consciousness, possesses an intimate means of contact with
Nature. The songs of birds, the noise of waterfalls, the rolling
of thunder, the whispering of wind in the pine-trees&mdash;all these
are utterances of the Absolute.</p>

<p>Hence the connection of Zen with the passionate love of
Nature which is so evident in Far Eastern poetry and art.</p>

<p>Personally I believe that this passion for Nature worked
more favourably on literature than on painting. The typical
Zen picture, dashed off in a moment of exaltation&mdash;perhaps a
moonlit river expressed in three blurs and a flourish&mdash;belongs
rather to the art of calligraphy than to that of painting.</p>

<p>In his more elaborate depictions of nature the Zen artist
is led by his love of nature into that common pitfall of lovers&mdash;sentimentality.
The forms of Nature tend with him to
function not as forms but as symbols.</p>

<p>Something resembling the mystic belief which Zen
embraces is found in many countries and under many names.
But Zen differs from other religions of the same kind in that
it admits only one means by which the perception of Truth
can be attained. Prayer, fasting, asceticism&mdash;all are dismissed
as useless, giving place to one single resource, the method of
self-hypnosis which I have here described.</p>

<p>I have, indeed, omitted any mention of an important
adjunct of Zen, namely tea-drinking, which was as constant a
feature in the life of Zen monasteries as it is here in the régime
of charwomen and girl-clerks. I have not space to describe
the various tea-ceremonies. The tendency of monasteries was
to create in them as in every part of daily life a more and more<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>
elaborate ritual, calculated to give some pattern to days otherwise
devoid of any incident. We possess minute descriptions
of every ceremony&mdash;the initiation of novices, the celebration of
birth and death anniversaries of the Patriarchs, the procedure
in cases of sickness, madness, disobedience, disappearance or
death of monks; the selection and investiture of abbots; the
lectures, liturgies and sessions which constituted the curriculum
of Zen instruction.</p>

<p>In China decay set in after the fifteenth century. The Zen
monasteries became almost indistinguishable from those of
popular, idolatrous Buddhism. In Japan, on the other hand,
Zen has remained absolutely distinct and is now the favourite
creed of the educated classes. It has not hitherto conducted
any propaganda in Europe, whereas the Amida Sect has sent
out both missionaries and pamphlets. But I believe that
Zen would find many converts in England. Something rather
near it we already possess. Quakerism, like Zen, is a non-dogmatic
religion, laying stress on the doctrine of Immanence.
But whereas the Quakers seek communion with the Divine
Spark in corporate meditation and deliberately exploit the
mysterious potencies of crowd-psychology&mdash;the Zen adept
probes in solitude (or at least without reference to his neighbour)
for the Buddha within him.</p>

<p>In cases where a Quaker meeting passes in silence, the
members having meditated quietly for a whole hour, a very
near approach to a Zen gathering has been made. But more
often than not the Holy Spirit, choosing his mouthpiece with
an apparent lack of discrimination, quickly descends upon some
member of the meeting. The ineffable, which Zen wisely
refused to express, is then drowned in a torrent of pedestrian
oration.</p>

<p>Some, then, may turn to Zen as a purer Quakerism. Others
will be attracted to it by the resemblance of its doctrines to the
hypotheses of recent psychology. The Buddha consciousness
of Zen exactly corresponds to the Universal Consciousness
which, according to certain modern investigators, lies hid
beneath the personal Consciousness. Such converts will probably
use a kind of applied Zen, much as the Japanese have
done; that is to say, they will not seek to spend their days in<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>
complete Samādhi, but will dive occasionally, for rest or
encouragement, into the deeper recesses of the soul.</p>

<p>It is not likely that they will rest content with the traditional
Eastern methods of self-hypnosis. If certain states of
consciousness are indeed more valuable than those with which
we are familiar in ordinary life&mdash;then we must seek them
unflinchingly by whatever means we can devise. I can
imagine a kind of dentist’s chair fitted with revolving mirrors,
flashing lights, sulphurous haloes expanding and contracting&mdash;in
short a mechanism that by the pressure of a single knob
should whirl a dustman into Nirvāna.</p>

<p>Whether such states of mind are actually more valuable
than our ordinary consciousness is difficult to determine.
Certainly no one has much right to an opinion who has not
experienced them. But something akin to Samādhi&mdash;a
sudden feeling of contact with a unity more real than the
apparent complexity of things&mdash;is probably not an uncommon
experience. The athlete, the creative artist, the lover, the
philosopher&mdash;all, I fancy, get a share of it, not when seeking
to escape from the visible world; but rather just when that
world was seeming to them most sublimely real.</p>

<p>To seek by contemplation of the navel or of the tip of the
nose a repetition of spiritual experiences such as these seems
to us inane; and indeed the negative trance of Zen is very
different from the positive ecstasies to which I have just
referred. I say that it is different; but how do I know?
“Zen,” said Bodhidharma, “cannot be described in words nor
chronicled in books”; and I have no other experience of Zen.
If I <i>knew</i>, I might transmit to you my knowledge, but it would
have to be by a direct spiritual communication, symbolised
only by a smile, a gesture, or the plucking of a flower.</p>

<p>I need not therefore apologise for having given a purely
external and historical account of Zen, a creed whose inner
mysteries are admittedly beyond the scope of words.</p>

MOKUAN.</h2>

<p>The Nikkōshū<a name="FNanchor_11_11" id="FNanchor_11_11"></a><a href="#Footnote_11_11" class="fnanchor">[11]</a>, a diary by the priest Gidō, has the following
entry under the year 1378 (month and day uncertain):</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>To-day Donfu<a name="FNanchor_12_12" id="FNanchor_12_12"></a><a href="#Footnote_12_12" class="fnanchor">[12]</a> came, and we fell to talking of Mokuan.
It seems that he was once known as Ze-itsu. But on becoming
a pupil of the priest Kenzan<a name="FNanchor_13_13" id="FNanchor_13_13"></a><a href="#Footnote_13_13" class="fnanchor">[13]</a>, he changed his name to
Mokuan. Afterwards he went to China and entered the
Honkakuji<a name="FNanchor_14_14" id="FNanchor_14_14"></a><a href="#Footnote_14_14" class="fnanchor">[14]</a>, where he became the disciple of Ryō-an<a name="FNanchor_15_15" id="FNanchor_15_15"></a><a href="#Footnote_15_15" class="fnanchor">[15]</a> and
was made librarian. Here he published at his own expense
(lit. “selling his shoes”) the <i>Second Collection of Sayings
by Korin</i>.</p>

<p>Subsequently he lived at the Shōtenji at Soochow, and
was warden there under Nanso<a name="FNanchor_16_16" id="FNanchor_16_16"></a><a href="#Footnote_16_16" class="fnanchor">[16]</a>, dying soon afterwards.</p>

<p>When he first came to China he spent some time at the
Jōji Monastery at Hangchow and from there visited the
Rokutsūji on the shores of the Western Lake. This
monastery was inhabited by the followers of Mokkei. The
abbot greeted Mokuan with a smile, saying to him: “Last
night I dreamt that our founder Mokkei came back again.
You must be his reincarnation”; and he gave to Mokuan
Mokkei’s two seals, white and red. Henceforward he was
known as Mokkei the Second.</p></div>

<h2>BIBLIOGRAPHY.</h2>


<h3>(1) EUROPEAN.</h3>

<p>The only writer who has made extracts from the works
of Bodhidharma is Père Wieger, whose remarks (in his
<i>Histoire des Croyances religieuses en Chine</i>, pp. 517-528) show
a robust and likeable bigotry.</p>

<p>Of Zen literature he says: “<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Nombre d’in-folio remplis de
réponses incohérentes, insensées.... Ce ne sont pas, comme
on l’a supposé, des allusions à des affaires intérieures, qu’il
faudrait connaître pour pouvoir comprendre. Ce sont des
exclamations échappées à des abrutis, momentanément
tirés de leur coma.</span>”</p>

<p>For the tea-ceremony in Japan see Okakura’s <i>Book of Tea</i>
(Foulis, 1919). The “military” Zen of Japan is well
described by Nukariya Kaiten in his <i>The Religion of the
Samurai, 1913</i>.</p>


<h3>(2) NATIVE.</h3>

<p>Most of this paper is derived from the section on Zen
(Series II, Vol. 15, seq.) in the “Supplement to the Collection
of Buddhist Scriptures,” <i>Dai Nihon Zoku Zō Kyō</i>.</p>

<p>Much of the information with regard to the Rokutsūji
School is taken from the article by Mr. Saga to which I have
already referred. For the Rokutsūji (“Temple of the Six
Penetrations”) see <i>Hsien Shun Lin-an Chih</i> (“Topography
of Hangchow, 1265-1275 <span class="smcap lowercase">A.D.</span>”), ch. 78, f. 9 recto.</p>

<p>I have also used Yamada’s <i>Zenshū Jiten</i> (Dictionary of
Zen) and the <i>Hekiganroku</i>, edited by Sōyen, 1920.</p>
